# CourseraML
Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng

This repository contains mini projects programmed in Octave done as assignments during the course to demonstrate different algorithms in ML.
Each exercise is associated with a pdf that explains about the algorithm used in that exercise. These are algorithms developed from scratch to understand the procedure to turn mathematical formulas and deductions to ML codes.
